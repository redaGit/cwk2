# Lab Scaling

Containerlab provides various options to scale the lab infrastructure and for external communication to systems that are not managed in Containerlab.

Some of those options are:
- Using a Linux bridge interface
- Attaching a containerlab node interface to the physical server interface
- Using macvlan

In this section, we will explore the Linux bridge interface option using 2 labs connected by a linux bridge.
